##ExpressMaintenance

This is a fork off the CodePlex project ExpressMaint. The CodePlex project hasn't been updated in a few years so I've (re) forked the project and am releasing it to use NuGet SQLManagementObjects11 (SQLServer2013)

Also added a static copy of the original web page describing process and usage.

Original project - SQLDBAtips.com.  Code from  https://expressmaint.codeplex.com/

Binary files available in the BIN folder.

###To Do

* Convert to C# (why? I like using C# and know it better than VB.NET)

* GUI interface for those scared of CLI. :)
